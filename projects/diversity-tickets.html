      <h2>The idea</h2>
      <p>Many conferences wish to foster diversity in their audience by supporting attendees who might not have the means — financial or otherwise — to get to their conference without help. Having each conference set up their own diversity ticketing solution is time-consuming, so we’ve come up with a way to have conferences interested in offering diversity ticketing sign up on a platform which will handle all of the submissions for them.</p>

      <h2>The process</h2>
      <p>We’ve partnered with Berlin study group <a href="http://rubymonstas.org/" target="_blank">Rubymonstas</a> to build together from the ground up an app which conference organisers worldwide will be able to use when working with us. Organisers can register their event online and set up a form to accept diversity ticketing submissions (as well as travel or accommodation grants if required). </p>
