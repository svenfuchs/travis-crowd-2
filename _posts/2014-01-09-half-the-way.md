*Michal Papis is the the current maintainer of RVM. Travis Foundation has secured funding for RVM from [PAYMILL](https://www.paymill.com/de) so that Michal can continue working on RVM for two months, beginning mid November.*

It’s been a month now as I’m doing my Open Source work under the wings of the Travis Foundation and PAYMILL. I implemented small bits of RVM 2.0, some of which I already released as gems. From the 9th to the 14th of December, I went to Munich to visit the PAYMILL offices: I finally got to know the excellent people sponsoring RVM development. It was a great trip! I wrote most of the gem-wrappers gem in that short time. It’s a replacement for RVM wrappers. I also backported gem-wrappers to RVM 1.25, which has been released now. It took quite a few days to integrate it, but I used this time to further clean up the codebase and improve few aspects of RVM, making the user experience better than ever.

While in Munich, I made some time to visit a few local events. The first one was a [Rails Girls Munich](https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_MUC) meeting on Tuesday. I did meet some delightful people learning Ruby on Rails. As I already had experiences with most of the web technologies used at the meeting, I was able to help [Sara](http://twitter.com/sareg0) implement a Javascript countdown till Christmas.

We had an amazing time learning JavaScript from the bottom up. One goal was trying to follow good practices, especially keeping code in small chunks. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/sareg0/Christmas-Counter).

The next day, I visited the [Munich Ruby User Group](http://munich.rubyshift.org/) - “RubyShift”, and I gave an intro to RVM wrappers and the gem-wrappers replacement. I’ve met inspiring people and hope to visit them again soon.

On my way from Munich to Berlin for the “Winter Hacking” with [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de), I worked on [RVM2-ui](https://github.com/rvm/rvm2-ui). It’s a Ruby library for handling the console output in RVM 2.0. By the time I reached Berlin I had a good test coverage and everything was working as expected.

At the event, I helped some of the attendees to understand Rails and automated testing. After the attendees made it through a day of hacking, there was some mulled wine and time to sum up everything. At the end of the day, I caught the train home, my head still buzzing with the amazing conversations we had about software and life.

Back home, I was charged with energy after such exciting times and got right back to coding. I made further improvements to [gem-wrappers](https://github.com/rvm/gem-wrappers), moved [pluginator](https://github.com/rvm/pluginator) to version 1.0.0 added support for Ruby versions older than 2.0. Most importantly, I have put more work into extracting pieces of RVM 1.x into RubyGems. That way they can be reused by anyone. The last of these is [gem-empty](https://github.com/rvm/gem-empty), another gem useful outside of RVM. Indeed, one of my gems has already found use outside of RVM: Josh Lubaway’s pre-commits tool is now [using pluginator](https://github.com/jish/pre-commit/issues/104).



All in all, a lot happened the last month, I made new friends and wrote lots of great code. What a way to end the year and start the new one!

*Michal Papis is visting Berlin from the 9th till 10th of January. He will give an introduction to RVM 2 at [rug-b](http://berlin.onruby.de/) on the 9th and afterwards discuss and brainstorm some new ideas for RVM 2 with Michal. Hope to see you all there, Berliners!*
