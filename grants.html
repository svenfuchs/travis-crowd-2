    <P>There are so many great ideas and creative developers in our community, that we think should be supported. But a wonderful idea is only the beginning and we want to help with one of the big next steps: financial support. If it's a young project that needs help being kickstarted or an established project to be continued: We want to help exceptional Open Source projects by supporting developers and organize funding. </P>

    <P><i>"The primary reason for us to support this great initiative is that we want to give something back to the community which helped us so much since we started. Without the great help and feedback from developers from all around Europe PAYMILL would not be where it is today."</i></P><br />
