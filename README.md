# Travis Foundation

See it live on [foundation.travis-ci.org](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/).

## Edit things

Features on the frontpage can be edited in `_data/features.yml`.

## Run locally

This page uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org) and GitHub pages.

To run it locally clone the repo and `cd` directly into it.

Within the repo run `$ bundle install` and then `$ jekyll serve --watch` to run a development server.

## Deploy

Push your changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
